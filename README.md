Inspired by the "todo:" comments in code, this project centers around organizing and prioritizing tasks to enable you to focus on what truly matters – completing your goals and progressing forward. todo: serves as a gentle reminder that every task, no matter how big or small, can be achieved with the right mindset and approach.

### Background
As a programmer, you may have spent countless hours working on various projects and often leave comments in the code to remind yourself of what needs to be done in the future. The word "todo:" is the keyword that programmers would be used for indicating unfinished tasks. Over time, it has taken on a deeper meaning as a symbol of progress and possibility.

As we worked on the project, the significance of "todo:" in our coding work could not be ignored. It served as a constant reminder of the unfinished tasks and the potential for growth and accomplishment. This inspired us to create a project centered around the guiding principles of "todo:" for task management and goal setting, helping users prioritize their tasks and achieve their goals with confidence.
